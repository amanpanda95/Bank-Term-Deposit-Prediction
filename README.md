# Bank-Term-Deposit-Prediction

Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict customer responses to a bank's term deposit marketing campaign. By identifying customers more likely to subscribe to term deposits, the model helps enhance campaign efficiency, improve targeted marketing, and optimize revenue generation. The project involves a full end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

Objectives
Customer Prediction: Build a classification model to identify customers likely to subscribe to term deposits.
Targeted Marketing Insights: Use customer segmentation to uncover patterns for personalized marketing efforts.
Campaign Optimization: Improve response rates and optimize campaign costs by predicting high-value customer segments.

Key Components
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, and preparing data for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into customer demographics, financial behavior, and past campaign responses.
Feature Engineering: Development of key features, such as engagement history, age groups, and financial indicators.
Classification Modeling:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost
Customer Segmentation:
    - Applied K-Means Clustering to identify target customer segments.
Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
Models and Techniques
Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable model for baseline predictions.
Random Forest: Non-linear model with feature importance insights.
XGBoost: Boosted model for higher accuracy and handling of complex patterns.
K-Means Clustering: Customer segmentation to improve marketing personalization.

Results
Model evaluation metrics indicate the effectiveness of each classification technique, allowing for comparison based on precision, recall, and accuracy.
Customer segments provide actionable insights for targeting specific demographics, optimizing marketing outreach.

Technologies Used
Python: Data processing, modeling, and visualization.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning model development and evaluation.
XGBoost: Advanced model training for enhanced accuracy.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizations for EDA and results presentation.
